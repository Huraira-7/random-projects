## Overview
This repository, networkspeed_typingtest_website, contains the following summarized content based on the files analyzed:

### networkspeed_typingtest_website/App.jsx
The App component returns a TypingSpeedTest component. This TypingSpeedTest component is imported from the Main.jsx file. The App component is then exported as the default export.

### networkspeed_typingtest_website/Main.jsx
This code defines a React component for a typing speed test. It initializes various state variables to track time, word count, character count, accuracy, and more. The component renders a user interface with a timer, word and character counters, and an input field for the user to type. As the user types, the component checks for completed words, updates the accuracy, and moves to the next word in the list. The component also handles starting and stopping the test.

### networkspeed_typingtest_website/Timer.jsx
This React component, Timer, displays a countdown timer in a circular format. It takes two props: initialTime, which sets the timer's duration, and startAnimation, which triggers the timer when set to true. The timer decrements every second, updating the circle's stroke dash offset to visualize the remaining time.

### networkspeed_typingtest_website/dictionary.js
A unique word dictionary is generated as a JavaScript array containing 200 English words. The dictionary includes a diverse range of words from various categories, covering topics such as emotions, actions, objects, and concepts. This dictionary can be used for various natural language processing tasks or word-based applications.
