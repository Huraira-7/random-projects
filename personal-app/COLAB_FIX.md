# Google Colab Build Fix

## ⚠️ Java 17 Required

The build requires Java 17, not Java 11.

## 🔧 If You Already Started Building

If you're already in Colab and got the Java error, run this cell:

```python
# Install Java 17
!apt-get update
!apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk

# Set JAVA_HOME
import os
os.environ['JAVA_HOME'] = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64'
os.environ['PATH'] = '/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/bin:' + os.environ.get('PATH', '')

# Verify installation
!java -version
```

Then continue with the rest of the build steps.

## ✅ Updated Notebook

The `Build_APK_Colab.ipynb` notebook has been updated to use Java 17.

If you restart, it will work correctly from the beginning.

## 🚀 Still Recommend EAS Build

EAS Build is much simpler and doesn't have these issues:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
npx eas login
npx eas build -p android --profile preview
```

Takes 10-15 minutes and works every time! See `BUILD_APK_GUIDE.md` for details.

**Fix applied!** Now you can build successfully. 🎉
